MOBI Grand Challenge
====================
MOBI Grand Challenge project (mobihacks.devpost.com) in kind cooperation with Aira Lab (www.aira.life) and Decentralized Technologies (www.dczd.tech)


Use case
========

## Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM)

1. Self driving car ask UTM for a permissioned path between point A and point B
1. UTM offers a path permissioned
1. Self driving car send an acceptance message
1. Robonomics network provider create a permission in form of smart contract
1. When contract achieve Ethereum blockchain, permission became immutable

## Trading for on road priority

### Actors


- Vehicle Alice (Agrees to be Slower/Accept Payments and give Rights of Way)
This car's passenger made a preference selection to pay for a ride less money but arrive later than average ETA, within certain estimated time/price limits.

- Vehicle Bob (Wants to be Faster/Pay for Rights of Way)
This car's passenger made a preference selection to pay for a ride more money but arrive faster, with a larger maximum estimated price limit - auction winner

- Vehicle Charlie (Wants to be Faster/Pay for Rights of Way)
This car's passenger made a preference selection to pay for a ride more money but arrive faster, with a smaller maximum estimated price limit - auction loser

### Scenario

- Alice is in the left lane. Charlie in the Right Lane follows Bob. 
- Both Bob and Charlie want to move to the left lane and sending that request to Alice.
- Alice sets the minimum price she is willing to accept to give the rights of way (slow down and let either Bob or Charlie in the left lane )
- Bob submits the maximum price he is willing to pay for space
- Charlie submits the maximum price he is willing to pay for space
- Vickery auction is conducted.
- Auction results revealed 
- Bob wins the auction
- Alice slows down to let Bob take place in front of her in the left lane

How to launch
=============

Preparation
-----------
1. Install `Nix` package manager [nixos.org/nix](https://nixos.org/nix/),
2. Download this project
```bash
git clone git@github.com:airalab/mobi_grand_challenge.git
```
3. Build each package you would like to launch
```bash
nix build -f $PACKAGE_NAME/release.nix
```

4. Source executables path from `result` directory
```bash
source ./result/setup.bash
```

5. Launch packages you need
```bash
roslaunch $PACKAGE_NAME $LAUNCHFILE_NAME
```

AIRA packages
-------------
We need two AIRA services to communicate with Robonoimcs network

1. First launch `robonomics_liability` node to connect with Robonomics network providers
```
source ./result/setup.bash
source ./liability.sh
```

2. Then launch `ethereum_common` node to have a ROS API to web3
```
source ./result/setup.bash
source ./ethereum_common.sh
```
